	"line": "Line charts display data points connected by straight" +
		" line segments. They are ideal for showing trends over" +
		" time or continuous data, making it easy to spot patterns," +
		" peaks, and valleys in a dataset.",

	"bar": "Bar charts represent categorical data with rectangular" +
		" bars whose lengths are proportional to the values they" +
		" represent. They excel at comparing discrete categories" +
		" side by side and support grouped, stacked, and" +
		" horizontal layouts.",

	"area": "Area charts are line charts with the region between the" +
		" line and the axis filled in. The filled region emphasizes" +
		" volume and magnitude of change over time, and stacked" +
		" area charts show how parts contribute to a whole.",

	"scatter": "Scatter plots display individual data points on a" +
		" two-dimensional plane, showing the relationship between" +
		" two variables. They are commonly used to identify" +
		" correlations, clusters, and outliers in datasets.",

	"pie": "Pie charts divide a circle into proportional slices to" +
		" show how parts make up a whole. They are best suited for" +
		" displaying a small number of categories where the" +
		" relative share of each category is the primary focus.",

	"gauge": "Gauge charts display a single value within a defined" +
		" range using a semi-circular arc, resembling a speedometer" +
		" or dial. Colored zones can indicate thresholds such as" +
		" normal, warning, and critical ranges.",

	"candlestick": "Candlestick charts visualize financial price" +
		" movements over time. Each candle shows the open, high," +
		" low, and close (OHLC) prices for a period. The body" +
		" color indicates whether the price moved up or down.",

	"histogram": "Histograms display the frequency distribution of" +
		" continuous data by grouping values into bins. The height" +
		" of each bar represents how many data points fall within" +
		" that bin's range, revealing the shape and spread of the" +
		" distribution.",

	"boxplot": "Box plots, also known as box-and-whisker plots, are" +
		" graphical representations used in statistics to display" +
		" the distribution of a dataset. They show key statistics" +
		" such as the minimum, first quartile, median, third" +
		" quartile, and maximum, allowing for a quick visual" +
		" summary of the data's spread and skewness.",

	"combo": "Combo charts overlay bar and line series on shared" +
		" category axes, making it easy to compare absolute values" +
		" (bars) with trends or rates (lines) in a single view." +
		" Bars render underneath and lines draw on top.",

	"treemap": "Treemap charts display hierarchical data as nested" +
		" rectangles whose areas are proportional to their values." +
		" A squarified layout algorithm arranges rectangles to" +
		" minimize aspect ratios, making it easy to compare sizes" +
		" across categories and subcategories at a glance.",

	"waterfall": "Waterfall charts show how an initial value is" +
		" affected by a series of intermediate positive or negative" +
		" values. Each bar floats, starting where the previous bar" +
		" ended. They are widely used for financial statements," +
		" variance analysis, and bridge charts.",

	"transform": "Data transforms are pure functions that process" +
		" series data before rendering. They include moving averages" +
		" (SMA, EMA, WMA) for smoothing, linear and polynomial" +
		" regression for trend fitting, Bollinger bands and min/max" +
		" envelopes for range analysis, LTTB downsampling for large" +
		" datasets, and binning for data grouping.",

	"sparkline": "Sparklines are compact inline mini-charts that" +
		" show trend at a glance without axes, labels, or legends." +
		" They are designed to be embedded in text, tables, or" +
		" dashboards where space is limited. Variants include line," +
		" area, and bar styles with optional markers and color bands.",
